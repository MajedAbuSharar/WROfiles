# WRO README FILE 

In the beggining , we would love to introduce ourselves , we ARE the LEGION , the LEGION contains three members , AYHAM , TAHA and MOHAMMED .

These three humble students , directed by their teacher "NOOR GHANNAM" , were able to go through every single obstacle they faced in their way .

# The members 

Each member of THE LEGION have participated in several missions including building the code , collecting the ***** , building and designing the
robot and many other messions ...
1. Taha :
  As he has participated in the previous version of the compitition , he had some important information to share with the other members ,
  he discribed them the instructions of the compition , rules , and what are the things they needed to complete the chalenge .
2. Ayham :
  Armed with the knowledge of robots and their work , and the experience he optained from other compititions , he had special abilities in
  programming and engineering 
3. Mohammed :
   Even that it was his first time in a compitition like this , he had some innovative ideas to share , and he participated in programming
   and designing the robot very much , and he optained some experience .
finally , the director 'teacher Noor Ghannam' , managed to supervise the work of the students and get them the material they need .

# Journey , Problems and Solutions
First we've been told about the competition 1 month before it !! , so we had to start as quick as possible .

We started the work by collecting the material we need to build the robot , we looked for the material and got them ready , and we started 
discussing about rules and the work , but in the second week , each member had it's own curcumstances to deal with and we got delayed for a week , 
but we managed to make up for lost time .

A week later , we started programming each part of the robot to make sure that everything was fine , all the parts were working great , except for 
the color sensor which was an absolute nightmare , it took us three days and evantually it burned so we stoped using it and replaced it with the 
ultrasonics . 

Then some other events came in the way , like 'Eid al-adha' so we got delayed once again .

Thankfully , our team was strong and we easelly made up for lost time .

After we finished programming ,  the only thing left was to design the robot itself , we started thinking about building it from scratch , but we had 
no time , so we bought an RC car module and started placing the material .

The diagram was simple every thing was moving perfectly , until one of the motors burned , we had to check that nothing else was damaged ,
but thankfully , nothing was damaged , and we spent the rist of the day fixing it ...

Some other problems we had in the way is , how are we gonna power up the raspberry pi ? , well we found that we need a power bank with 5v and 
3A minimum to start the raspberry pi , it was a very hard task to find one , but we found one in the end .

overall , despite the hard times we've been through , our team had fun and enjoyed every single moment together .

# Material 

1. 3 Ultrasonics :
   one for the front side
   two for the sides 'left and right'
2. A motor driver l298n :
   used to control the DC motors 'back and forward , left and right'
3. A USB camera :
   avoiding the opstacles in the field
4. Raspberry pi 4b:
   This is our micro controller , the mind of our robot
5. Breadboard :
   Used for expanding the Raspberry PINS
6. GPIO expander :
   expand the Raspberry PINS into the bread board
